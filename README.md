![alt text](https://github.com/kwonghua/3D_QuadDrawer/blob/main/example.png)

This program is a quad drawer on a grid, user can move the cursor on the grid and place vertices.  
Every 4th vertice makes a quad.  
For every vertex color can be changed, so making vertices of the quad different color makes it interpolate between then which leaves a cool effect.
